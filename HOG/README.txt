THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT 

- Run Python files img_resize_sketch.py and face2sketch_photos.py (face2sketch_photos_ar.py). Correct the tensor sizes. This code converts 
photograph image into sketch-like image.

- Run augmentation.py if you want to get augmented images. You can get
	- Zoomed images.
	- Rotated images.

- Run hog_calculator.py to calculate HOG features and distances between them. This code is
also writes those distances to csv by their distance type. (Eucludean, Chi Sq, Cosine Sim)

- Run R file calc.R to calculate accuracies.

Sincerely,

Onur Boyar
